# Multi-class-weather-image-recognition-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN-model
This project focuses on developing and implementing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using the VGG16 architecture for image classification of weather phenomena. Utilizing "The Weather Phenomenon DatabaseÂ (WEAPD)"

The repository contains 2 files:
1. VGG16_Model: includes the code. 
2. Weather recognition report.
